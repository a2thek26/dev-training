# 02 Requirements

## Client Background
ACME is a the worldwide leader of many manufactured goods. From the classic ACME Anvil, to ACME Pest Control and ACME Time Space Gun, they produce it all. For a long time, sales were booming and their customer base was lively, especially in the southwest. For decades, they were the go-to company for many consumer products simply due to their coverage across all markets. However, after years of sporadic product malfunctions and more and more incident reports being filed, even their once loyal following has all but vanished.

In recent months, they’ve decided to modernize their approach with what’s left of their existing customer base. They want to understand how customers are finding products and what messages are working so they can attract new customers. If we are able to provide a substantial analysis on how their current campaigns are running in an effort to better them, client is prepared to dump a lot of money into digital marketing for more elaborate and immersive endeavors. For now, landing pages are the first step to help track conversions.

## Project Overview
Client would like to create landing pages for their flagship product, ACME Anvil. They want to try out different messaging options to determine which ones are working better than others. These pages will be linked to from some of their existing digital banner ads. If they produce 15% increase in conversion in the first 3 months, client would be willing to try the same thing with some of their other products.

## Mandates

- Landing pages should be built so that client can add new variations easily.
- All pages should use the same layout and content structure.
- Content should change based on a variable in the url.
- There should be a default set of content if somehow a landing page is hit without a url variable.
- Dynamic sections include key messaging and product video.
- Static areas will include a coupon section, list of retailers, and product lineup blurb. (The client should still be able to edit these static areas but they will not change along with the other areas).
- The site should respond appropriately to screen size.
