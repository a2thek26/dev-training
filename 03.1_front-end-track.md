# 03 Front-end Track - Phase 1

>Based on the requirements, your role in this is that of a front-end developer. Another developer is handling the backend interface for client to make edits. Your primary objective as this type of developer will be to build out a prototype as well as handle any of the front-end styling and functionality that is required of the project.

## Objective
Client would like to see proof-of-concept before going "all-in" on a design. Our approach will be to build a functional prototype to have client approve the idea and so they can see how it will display on multiple viewports. This will be a functional wireframe. Widths in the wireframe are approximate, default to the nearest grid size per the css framework.

## Activities

- Start by creating an `index.html` file.
- Using the wireframe provided, build out a static page scaffolding with default Bootstrap look and feel.
- Add custom styling throughout to match the wireframe where appropriate. Any custom styles should either be in a style tag in the header or put in an external css file.
- Use the bootstrap and jQuery CDN to reference the css and javascript files.
- Use placeholders for any images (logos, video poster, etc)
- Links should go to “#” or “javascript:void(0);"
- Make the video play in a modal when the button is clicked.
- Assume the video will be a youbtube or vimeo link.
- Needs to respond appropriately to any screen size.

## Best Practices

- All images should utilize `alt` tags.
- Add all css assets in the `<head>` tags.
- Add all javascript before the closing `<body>` tag.
- Add the `meta viewport` tag
