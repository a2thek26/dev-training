# 04 Framework Track - Phase 1

> Based on the requirements, your role in this is that of a backend developer. Another developer is handling the styling and much of the frontend view creation. Your primary objective as this type of developer will be to build out the system for the frontend developer to use. Another major part of this role will be to create interfaces for administrators to interact with to manage content.


## Objective
Since client wants to see proof-of-concept first, it's not necessary to build anything that they need to edit on their own quite yet. We just want to set up the foundation to test the concept first - a prototype. We're going to use Laravel to get setup. Our application is expected to respond to unique urls. Some of those urls will have parameters in them that will eventually be tied directly with associated content. 

Use the views and styles that were created in `Front-end Track Phase 3` as your base. Create layouts and page content from that. Create a route and controller. Just worry about the **Anvil** product line first for the prototype. 

We haven't decided on the domain yet but the segments after the domain should respond to `/coyote-reboot/{code}` where `code` is the identifier for the set of information - so in our case `/coyote-reboot/anvil`.


## Setup
Laravel uses Composer. Similar to Bower or NPM, Composer manage dependencies - PHP packages. Additionally, it aids in autoloading classes. So, while you can tell your project what packages it needs to pull in, you can also tell your project how it should respond to directories and files that are already within your project. It is an essential part of modern PHP development.

Seriously, go [here](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md). Do what this says to get Composer set up. Feel free to dig into the details, it probably won't be wasteful...

Now that composer is set up, let's pull in Laravel. Create a new directory to work out of or from a previous lesson, it's up to you.

In the root of your project, run:

```
composer create-project laravel/laravel ./ dev-master --prefer-dist
```

Composer uses a registry called Packagist to get the source of the dependencies. Packagist is pretty much a database of repositories and the codes associated with the vendor who wrote them. So, this line is using the `composer` binary to call the `create-project` method while passing in 3 parameters - the source project, the local path to install it, and the version to install, and additionally passing an option for the distribution version versus the source version. Again, just check the composer documentation for the details.

It will take a minute to download. What the system is doing is cloning the `laravel/laravel` repository, taking **it's** composer file and checking all of it's dependencies and down the line. It then pulls in every package it needs. Some packages use the same packages as other dependencies, composer manages the system to only pull it in once. Everything should end up in a `vendor` directory in the root of the project.

Go ahead and add `/vendor` to your `.gitignore`.

## Activities
- Set up the database in `config/database.php`
- Use `artisan` to create a controller and a model.
- Build the model and database table using a migration.
- Populate the database with the `anvil` data.
- Create a route that responds to `coyote-reboot` and `coyote-reboot/anvil`. The result should be the same. 
- Make it so that the views and styles created before are used as the response.
- Only concern yourself with the default layout for now but know that alternative layouts could eventually be tied to content types.

 **Extra Credit**
- Use `Elixir` to build your less and js files.
- Create a model relationship between page content and theme and use
