# 04 Framework Track - Phase 1

> Based on the requirements, your role in this is that of a backend developer. Another developer is handling the styling and much of the frontend view creation. Your primary objective as this type of developer will be to build out the system for the frontend developer to use. Another major part of this role will be to create interfaces for administrators to interact with to manage content.


## Objective
Since Client wants to see proof-of-concept first, its not necessary to build anything that they need to edit on their own quite yet. We just want to set up the foundation to test the concept first - a prototype. We're going to use Laravel to get setup. Our application is expected to respond to unique urls. Some of those urls will have parameters in them that will eventually be tied directly with associated content. 

Use the views and styles that were created in `Front-end Track Phase 3` as your base. Create layouts and page content from that. Create a route and controller. Just worry about the **Anvil** product line first for the prototype. 

We haven't decided on the domain yet but the segments after the domain should respond to `/coyote-reboot/{code}` where `code` is the identifier for the set of information - so in our case `/coyote-reboot/anvil`.


## Setup

### Composer
Laravel uses Composer. Similar to Bower or NPM, Composer manage dependencies - PHP packages. Additionally, it aids in autoloading classes. So, while you can tell your project what packages it needs to pull in, you can also tell your project how it should respond to directories and files that are already within your project. It is an essential part of modern PHP development.

Seriously, go [here](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md). Do what this says to get Composer set up. Feel free to dig into the details, it probably won't be wasteful...

Now that composer is set up, let's pull in Laravel. Create a new directory to work out of or from a previous lesson, it's up to you.

In the root of your project, run:

```
composer create-project laravel/laravel ./ dev-master --prefer-dist
```

Composer uses a registry called Packagist to get the source of the dependencies. Packagist is pretty much a database of repositories and the codes associated with the vendor who wrote them. So, this line is using the `composer` binary to call the `create-project` method while passing in 3 parameters - the source project, the local path to install it, and the version to install, and additionally passing an option for the distribution version versus the source version. Again, just check the composer documentation for the details.

It will take a minute to download. What the system is doing is cloning the `laravel/laravel` repository, taking **it's** composer file and checking all of it's dependencies and down the line. It then pulls in every package it needs. Some packages use the same packages as other dependencies, composer manages the system to only pull it in once. Everything should end up in a `vendor` directory in the root of the project.

Go ahead and add `/vendor` to your `.gitignore`.

> There's no shortage of information to understand about composer. Throughout the course of medium to large projects, it is used. It's important to know how it works in multiple situations. 

### Namespace and Autoloading

Since you've arrived at this point, it's probably worth mentioning namespaces. Namespaces are a way for you to use the dependencies that you've pulled in or built without having to necessarily know where they live within the filesystem. With that being said, you still need to know the namespace. Composer helps us with identifying the path to the root of a project, from there, you can expect a common convention for how to `use` a class.

Say you have a file called `Auth.php`. 

```
<?php namespace Acme\Auth;

class Auth {
    
    public function check($login, $password)
    {
        // ...do stuff
    }
    
}
```

In your application somewhere, historically, you might have used this class like this (simplified pseudo code):
 
 ```
<?php

 require 'Auth.php';
 
 $auth = new Auth();
 $login = $_POST('email');
 $password = $_POST('password');
 
 if( $auth->login($login, $password)) {

    //...allow access or whatever
    
 }
 ```

This is relatively straightforward, but what if `Auth.php` is buried in a dozen directories in relation to the file that is calling it? Consider this file structure:

```
- index.php <=== You are here
- /lib
-- /auth
--- Auth.php
- /vendor
-- /acme
--- /auth
---- Auth.php <== You want to use this
```

Well, in `index.php` you would need to give it the path to include:

```
require 'vendor/acme/auth/Auth.php';
```

OK, what if you're working on an `Auth` class of your own that needs to use something in the `Auth` class in the vendor directory?

Now your path looks like this:

```
require '../../vendor/acme/auth/Auth.php';
```

This is going to get tedious, right? I suppose you could create a global path function and/or constant to the root to make this a bit easier but a lot of frameworks already do this for you. So you might do something like this:

```
require base_path('vendor/acme/auth/Auth.php');

// or 

require base_path().'lib/auth/Auth.php';
```

Better, but autoloading makes this even easier and it's a part of composer. Like I said, composer can help with identifying where something lives within the filesystem so you don't have to reference it differently every time you need it.

> Not going to go over the manual setup of autoloading since Laravel inherently does this for us. Again, it is something that you should have a base understanding of though. Read about it [here](https://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md#autoloading).

Looking back at the vendor `Auth` class you'll notice a namespace in the top of the file `Acme\Auth`. Because composer is aware of the where the root of the namespace is, you can use the namespace only to define what to use.
 
 So our new `index.php` might look like this:
 
 ```
 /**
  * In practice, this autoload 'require' would happen in some bootstrap file so that
  * it is called on every request, that way you only need to require it once. 
  */
 require __DIR__.'/vendor/autoload.php';
 
 use Acme\Auth\Auth;
 
 $auth = new Auth;
 // ...and so on
 ```
 
 So the `use` replaces the `require` and relies on composer's config to define where the starting point for the namespace is.
 
 So to reference your own library, you might set this in your project's composer file:
 
 ```
 {
    "autoload" : {
        "psr-4" : {
            "MyNamespace" : "/lib"
        }
    }
 }
 ```
 Where the `MyNamespace` is the desired namespace to use and `/lib` is the path to the root of where the namespace should begin.
 
 If you look back to the directory structure for our library:
 
 ```
 - /lib
 -- /auth
 --- Auth.php
 ```

You can assume `MyNamespace\Auth\Auth` to pull in that class.

When adding new namespaces like this, you'll need to run `composer dump-autoload` in order to compile a new autoload file which the system uses to keep track what namespaces have been registered. This might sound more complicated that it needs to be but in practice, you only need to do it periodically.

> There are a number of options for how to autoload differently. Be sure to check the documentation for different approaches. Different situations have different needs so there's a time when any might be appropriate.

## Activities
- Set up the database in `config/database.php`
- Use `artisan` to create a controller and a model.
- Build the model and database table using a migration.
- Populate the database with the `anvil` data.
- Create a route that responds to `coyote-reboot` and `coyote-reboot/anvil`. The result should be the same. 
- Make it so that the views and styles created before are used as the response.
- Only concern yourself with the default layout for now but know that alternative layouts could eventually be tied to content types.

 **Extra Credit**
- Use `Elixir` to build your less and js files.
- Create a model relationship between page content and theme and implement
