# 04 Framework Track - Phase 2

> Based on the requirements, your role in this is that of a backend developer. Another developer is handling the styling and much of the frontend view creation. Your primary objective as this type of developer will be to build out the system for the frontend developer to use. Another major part of this role will be to create interfaces for administrators to interact with to manage content.

## Objective
The client likes our prototype and wants to move forward with building out the rest of the application. They also want to be able to administer this on their own. They have an existing website but they are open to building this separate from that. You will build out the admin.

## Activities
- Build backend sections for a `Dashboard`, `Products` and `Themes`
- Each "model" should have a `list`, `create` and `edit` view.
- List views should be paginated, giving the option to show 10 results per page
- Admins should be able to associate Products to Themes via the backend interface.
- The admin should live at `/backend`.
- The product list should live at `/backend/products`.
- The theme list should live at `/backend/themes`.

### Extra Credit
- Build an authentication system for access.
- `Users` should be able to log in before they can see the backend.
- Build a backend interface to add new users to the system.
